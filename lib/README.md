# Lib

This is the shared library powering the Scala apps.

Gladly, lots of code can be reused on the pwa/extension/backend/internal tools.

## Common
The [common](common) module includes all the logic that can be shared on all the apps.

## Api
The [api](api) module includes the shared APIs like the backend client, storage, etc.

## UI
The [ui](ui) module includes the shared components between the browser extension and the PWA.
